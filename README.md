# TaxGenie-IBM-Watsonx-TechXchange-Hackathon
TaxGenie simplifies tax filing for Canadians by using IBM WatsonxOrchestrate. It automates document ingestion, classification, and data extraction with AI-driven data validation and real-time optimisations via the Canadian Revenue Agency's API. This prototype currently lacks integration with WatsonxDiscovery and error handling but serves as a POC.
